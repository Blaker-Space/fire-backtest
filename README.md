FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) is a movement based around early retirement through a high savings rate with savings invested into index funds that track the S&P 500 or the total US stock market (funds such as VTSAX or its ETF equivalent, VTI).

In this repository, I propose an alternate to traditional FIRE: ABS (Antifragile Black Swan) FIRE, which can be used to protect new FIRE retirees from early, large drawdowns from black swan events as well as long-term bear markets.
